# Pizza-Sales_Report
# 🍕 Power BI x MySQL | Pizza Sales Performance Dashboard

A few weeks ago, I decided to challenge myself — not with another tutorial, but with something that would test how well I could think and build like a **Data Analyst**.

That’s how I started working on my **Pizza Sales Performance Report** — a complete analytics project built using **MySQL** and **Power BI**, where I analyzed, visualized, and told the story behind one year of pizza sales.

## ⚙️ Step 1: From Raw Data to SQL Insights

It all began with a CSV file — thousands of rows filled with pizza orders, sizes, prices, and timestamps.  
I imported the dataset into **MySQL** and began exploring it through SQL queries.

The goal was simple: **turn raw sales data into business insights.**

Over time, I wrote **25+ SQL queries** to clean the data, extract key metrics, and uncover meaningful patterns.

**Key Metrics I Derived:**
- 💰 **Total Revenue:** 817.86K  
- 🍕 **Total Pizzas Sold:** 49,574  
- 🧾 **Total Orders:** 21,350  
- 📦 **Average Order Value:** 38.31  
- 🍽️ **Average Pizzas per Order:** 2.32  

Then came the fun part — identifying **trends and performance drivers**:
- Which days and months brought the most sales?  
- Which pizza types performed the best (and worst)?  
- What’s the customer ordering behavior across size and category?

## 📊 Step 2: From Queries to Dashboard Design

Once the data was cleaned and aggregated, I connected it to **Power BI** and started transforming numbers into visuals.

I designed a **two-page interactive dashboard**:

### 🏠 **Home Dashboard**
Focused on overall performance:
- Daily & monthly order trends  
- Sales breakdown by **category** and **size**  
- KPI cards tracking key business metrics  
- Insights on busiest days and months  

### 🍕 **Best & Worst Sellers Dashboard**
Focused on product-level insights:
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas by **revenue**, **quantity**, and **orders**  
- Dynamic **date slicer** and **category filter** for exploration  
- Page navigation using custom buttons  

I used visuals like **bar charts, doughnuts, columns, funnels, and area charts** to balance clarity and aesthetics.

## 💡 Step 3: Insights That Matter

Here’s what the dashboard revealed:

- 🍕 **Classic Category** generated the most revenue and orders  
- 📏 **Large-size pizzas** made up **45.89% of total sales**  
- 📅 **July** and **January** were the busiest months  
- 🗓️ **Fridays and Saturdays** had the highest order volumes  
- 🔝 The **Top 5 pizzas** contributed nearly **60% of total revenue** — showing clear bestsellers and improvement areas

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project wasn’t just about SQL or Power BI — it was about **thinking like a data storyteller**.

I learned how to:
- Clean, organize, and analyze large datasets using **MySQL**
- Build effective **data models** and **DAX measures** in Power BI
- Combine **SQL logic with visualization** for an end-to-end analysis
- Design dashboards that **tell a story**, not just show numbers
